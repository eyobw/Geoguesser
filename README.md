>####About the Project


This project plan is written to provide a clear definition of school project for the course Media Product project. It will explain everything about our project including the pro-ject’s goals and objectives. Additionally, this plan is thought to be helpful for our re-spective teachers to understand and follow our progress during the course. 

As students and participants in this project our responsibilities include keeping constant interaction with our customer to help us bring a product that best matches our customer’s need. Our product is to develop a game that requires players to give a guess where a particular geographical region or picture is located on a map. The more closer a player’s guess on the map is to the actual place on the same map, the more point the player will win.

This game is being developed following the proposal given by Olli Alm. According to our first discussion, Olli has marked his expectations and what he wants to see during the final delivery. His expectations and every method we are planning to use in order to accomplish them are also discussed in this project plan.
In this project plan the following core informations are presented and discussed
